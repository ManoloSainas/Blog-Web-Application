## Project Description

• The goal of this project is to create a Blog-type web application using Node.js, Express.js, EJS and Bootstrap.

• The application allows users to create, view, edit and delete blog posts.

• Posts will not be saved between sessions, as no database will be used in this version.

• The layout and design are implemented using Bootstrap.

##  Features

1. Post creation: users can create new blog posts.
   
2. Post visualization: the home page displays one post at a time, and the user can navigate between posts using buttons.
   
3. Edit/Delete posts: users can edit and delete existing posts.
   
4. Styling: the application should be well-styled and responsive, providing a good experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technical Requirements

1. Node.js and Express.js: the application will be a web server built with Node.js and Express.js. Express will handle routing and middleware.
   
2. EJS: used as a template engine to generate dynamic HTML based on the application's state.

3. Bootstrap: used for styling and responsiveness, ensuring a clean and consistent layout on all devices.
