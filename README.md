# Blog Web Application

## Project Description

• The goal of this project is to create a Blog-type web application using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS.

• The application allows users to create and view blog posts.

• Posts will not be saved between sessions, as no database will be used in this version.

##  Features

1. Post creation: users can create new blog posts.
   
3. Post visualization: the home page displays all created posts.
   
5. Edit/Delete posts: users can edit and delete existing posts.
   
7. Styling: the application should be well-styled and responsive, providing a good experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technical Requirements

1. Node.js and Express.js: the application will be a web server built with Node.js and Express.js. Express will handle routing and middleware.
   
3. EJS: used as a template engine to generate dynamic HTML based on the application's state.
